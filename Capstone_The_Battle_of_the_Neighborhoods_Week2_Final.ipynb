    "With the COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses like offices, schools, colleges, etc. have been shut down forcing people to work/study from home. However, the food industry personnel do not have the opportunity to work from home and are required to continue with their daily work activities while adhering to the safety measures.\n",

    "What’s concerning is that it can survive on different surfaces for quite a long time and once we come in contact with a contaminated surface, we can get infected too. This naturally makes us think twice before ordering food online or before visiting a restaurant to dine-in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would also change consumer behavior and would affect our decision while choosing any food outlet. Consumers would not only look at food outlets that serve good quality food at a good price but will also look at the hygiene rating and the area in which the food outlet is located in to ensure that safety and hygiene are not being compromised."

    "From our analysis, we noticed that most of the restaurants have an average rating of 3.8. We also noticed that the avg. price of most restaurants is about 25 dollars per person which is not that expensive for San Francisco.\n",

    "Zomato’s “price range” feature was also able to give us valuable insights. This feature ranges from 1 to 4(1 being the pocket friendly to 4 being expensive) and turns out that most of the restaurants fall somehwere in the middle with respect to pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting yet concerning observation was made regarding the “hygiene rating” of the restaurants. All the restaurants had a hygiene rating of 0 which means these restaurants were not rated in terms of hygiene. Zomato should work on ensuring that hygiene ratings are present for all restaurants especially with this pandemic in place as it would help consumers ensure their safety and hygiene is not being compromised.\n",

    "The outlets in Cluster 1 have the highest price (although not by much), decent ratings,  but this cluster also has the highest number of coronavirus cases when compared to other clusters. Food outlets in this cluster must be extra careful while preparing and delivering food. If you do order food from here, I would recommend you take extra precautions and be very careful.\n",

    "The clustering exercise revealed that restaurants in San Francisco and some in {Neighborhood} are safe to order from and also provide the best quality food while resturants in {Bad Neighborhood} are also safe to order from but are more on the higher end in terms of price. Based on the visitor's choice of rating, price and other requirements, he/she can choose amongst different food outlets located in these three clusters."
